**The subjunctive**  

The subjunctive is used only in select phrases or situations in English. One finds vestiges of it in certain hypothetical expressions (using "**if** **+ to be**") and in certain set phrases. (In many cases the subjunctive -- considered archaic or literary -- is replaced by the [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) "**would**," used to express the [conditional](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/8.html).) Other meanings often communicated by the subjunctive in other languages will be expressed by [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) verbs in English.

In constructions using "**if** **+ to be**" the subjunctive will amount to using the form "**were**" (instead of "**was**") with the first and third persons singular ("**I**" and "**he**," "**she**," or "**it**"). (In spoken English, and in much informal writing, "**was**" will still be used.)
