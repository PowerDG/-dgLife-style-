**Space**

In their simplest form, prepositions are used to indicate position (in time or space) of one thing with respect to another:

- I put the book on the table.
- She arrived before the others.
- He came toward me.

There are many prepositions. Here is a partial list, with examples:

- to -- He gave the book to his friend.
- at -- They arrived at his house at 5    o'clock.
- of -- It was the third day of the month.
- from -- That young women comes from Thailand.
- on -- She put the plate on the table.
- under -- The cat crawled under the bed.
- over -- The boy threw the rock over the tree.
- underneath -- The rabbit escaped underneath the    fence.
- before -- (**time**) She arrived before the movie    started.
- after -- He called his mother after he finished    shopping.
- in front of -- His mother parked her car in front of    his apartment.
- behind -- The dog ran behind the house.
- for -- He went to the store for more milk.
- toward -- The criminal walked toward him with a    gun.
- against -- Everyone was against that idea.
- around -- The athletes ran around the track six    times.
- close to -- He placed the food close to the    squirrel.
- far from -- He placed the food far from the lion.
- next to -- He was hot, so he sat down next to the air    conditioning.
- facing -- She sat down on the other side of the table,    facing him.
- in the midst of -- I don't know where to find any free time    in the midst of these emergencies.

**Usage of prepositions**

The use of prepositions is one of the most complex aspects of English, and it is impossible to cover all cases. Some general guidelines, however, may be helpful.

**Geography**

Movement toward a town, country, state, or continent is generally expressed by the preposition "**to**"; presence in a city, state, etc. is expressed by "**in**"; movement away from a city, state, etc., is expressed by "**from**" (if the verb requires a pronoun):

- When are you going to Canada.
- He went to Asia last year.
- I spent three years in London.
- She was born in Normandy.
- He comes from Mexico.

**Transportation**

As a general rule, the preposition "**by**" is used to describe how one has traveled. The prepositions "**in**" and "**on**" describe one's presence inside a vehicle. In the case of small vehicles (a car, a helicopter...), the preposition "**in**" is required:

- I came by bike.
- Traveling by plane is my favorite.
- I was already on (in) the train when he    arrived.
- She is waiting for me in the car.

**Time**

To designate an hour the preposition "**at**" is used:

- Let's meet at six o'clock.
- They arrived at 4:45.

For dates and days of the week, one uses "**on**":

- His birthday is on Monday.
- It happened on March 3, 1997.

For months one uses "**in**":

- My birthday is in September.
- We will begin work in August.

To express duration, the preposition "**for**" is used; "**in**" can be used to express the time it will take to complete a task:

- I am going away for a few days.
- He worked with them for three years.
- I can read that book in a day.

 

**Indirect objects**

The preposition "**to**", which generally precedes an indirect object, will disappear before a noun (or pronoun) when the indirect object precedes a direct object. ("**To**" will be retained when the indirect object follows a direct object.)

Examples :

- She gave John the ticket.
- **Mais :** She gave the ticket to John.

or:

- He sent her a letter.
- **Mais :** He sent a letter to her.
- **Ou :** He sent it to her.

This can also be seen in certain phrases in which the direct object is implicit.

- I already told it to him.
- **Mais :** I already told him (the news).
