**Habitual actions in the past**  

To describe habitual, repeated actions in the past, one generally uses the construction "**used to + verb.**" Thus:

- When I was little, we used to go camping a lot.
- When my father was in school, they used to slap children who didn't behave.
- I used to work days, but now I work the night shift.

In spoken English, one often uses the common construction with the [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) "**would**," followed by the main verb:

- When we were kids, we would haze each other quite a bit.
- When I was little, we would go camping a lot.
- When my father was in school, they would slap children who didn't behave.
