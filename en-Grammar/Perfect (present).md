**Present perfect**

- [General principles](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/5.html#generalites)
- [Recent past](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/5.html#passe immediat)

**General principles**

The present perfect describes an action or emotion which began in the past and which continues in the present. It is formed by using the auxilary "**to have**" with the [past participle](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/15.html):

- I have always wanted to visit Israel.
- Money has always been the problem and not the solution.
- I have discovered the answer.

After such expressions as "**since**," "**for**," "**how** **long**," etc., one generally uses the present perfect or even the [present perfect progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/6.html):

- I have been in Paris for three weeks
- He has been telling that story for years!
- How long have you lived in Quebec?

In the negative, the present perfect expresses and action which has not yet occurred:

- I haven't finished yet.
- She said she would call, but she hasn't called.

**Recent past** 

In conjunction with the word "**just**", the present perfect or the preterit can be used to express the recent past:

- I (have) just arrived.
- The film has just come out [or: The film just came    out].

Note: do not confuse this use of "**just**" (which indicates the recent past) with "**just about**," which indicates, to the contrary, something which will happen in the near future:

- I have just about finished. (= I have almost finished; I will    finish soon.)
