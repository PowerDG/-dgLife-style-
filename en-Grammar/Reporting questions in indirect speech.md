**Reporting questions in indirect speech**

 Reporting questions using the question words what, where, when, why, how, etc.
 When we want to report a question that starts with a question word, we include the question word in the reported speech. 

 <What’s the time?>   arrow  He asked me what the time was.
 <Where do you live?> arrow He asked me where I lived. 

 When we report a question, we do not put the verb in the interrogative form.
 They asked me where I lived.
 Not
 They asked me where did I live. 

 Reporting questions without question words
 We use if or whether to report a yes-no question that doesn’t use a question word. 
 <Do you want an ATM card?> arrow She asked me if I wanted an ATM card.
 <Is life expensive in Brazil?> arrow He asked me whether life was expensive in Brazil.
 <Can I open an account?> arrow She asked whether she could open an account. 

 Remember! You need to coordinate the tense of the verb in the reported  question with the verb that introduces the reported question.
