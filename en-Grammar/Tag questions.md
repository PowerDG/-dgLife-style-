**Tag questions**

 We often use tag questions in spoken English to check information and to  ask for confirmation. We form tag questions with auxiliary or modal  verbs or the main verb be, followed by a pronoun. 

 You’re Tom Cruise, aren’t you?		She speaks Russian, doesn’t she? That’s not Julia Roberts, is it?		This doesn’t cost much, does it? 

 A falling intonation on a tag question means you feel certain about what  you are saying. A rising intonation means you are not sure and need  confirmation. 

 If the first part of the sentence is affirmative, the tag question is generally negative. If the first part of the sentence is negative, the tag question is generally affirmative. 

 You are French, aren’t you?		You aren’t French, are you? Carly can swim, can’t she?		Carly can’t swim, can she?
