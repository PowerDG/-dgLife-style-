**Present participles**

**Formation**

The present participle is formed by adding the ending"**--ing**" to the infinitive (dropping any silent "**e**"at the end of the infinitive):

- to sing --> singing
- to talk --> talking
- to bake --> baking
- to be --> being
- to have --> having

**Use**

**A.** The present participle may often function as an adjective:

- That's an interesting book.
- That tree is a weeping willow.

**B.** The present participle can be used as a noun denoting an activity (this form is also called a gerund):

- Swimming is good exercise.
- Traveling is fun.

**C.** The present participle can indicate an action that is taking place, although it cannot stand by itself as a verb. In these cases it generally modifies a noun (or pronoun), an adverb, or a past participle:

- Thinking myself lost, I gave up all hope.
- Washing clothes is not my idea of a job.
- Looking ahead is important.

**D.** The present participle is used in progressive verb tenses, which indicate continuing actions or actions in progress (the [present progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/11.html), the [future progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/19.html), the [present perfect progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/6.html)) :

- I am eating my dinner.
- He was walking across the park.
- We will be calling you tomorrow.

**E.** The present participle may be used with "**while**"or "**by**" to express an idea of simultaneity ("**while**") or causality ("**by**") :

- He finished dinner while watching television.
- By using a dictionary he could find all the words.
- While speaking on the phone, she doodled.
- By calling the police you saved my life!

**F.** The present participle of the auxiliary "**have**"may be used with the past participle to describe a past condition resulting in another action:

- Having spent all his money, he returned home.
- Having told herself that she would be too late, she accelerated.
