 **Direct and indirect discourse**

When one reports what others have said word for word, this is called "direct discourse." It is generally signaled by the presence of quoation marks:

- Philippe said, "I'll come if I have the time."
- My roommate said, "Clean the place up, or get out of    here!"

When one paraphrases the words of others, writing them so as to avoid direct quotation, this is called "indirect discourse." Indirect discourse entails certain changes:

**A.** Quotation marks are not used:

> **direct discourse:** He told me, "You're stupid"
>     **indirect discourse:** He told me that I was stupid.

**B.** When the verb in the reported discourse is conjugated, is it generally preceded by "**that**"; however, the inclusion of "**that**" is optional

- She said that she would be late.
- **OR:** She said she would be late.
- They informed us that the plane was delayed.
- **OR:** They informed us the plane was    delayed. 

**C.** Imperative forms, when recounted in indirect discourse, generally become infinitive constructions:

> direct discourse: 
>
> He told me, "Write to me."
>
> indirect discourse:
>
>  He told me to write him.
>
>  
>
> **direct discourse:** I told them, "Get out of here!"
>  **indirect discourse:** I told them to get out of here. 

**D.** When a quotation is put in indirect discourse, care must be taken to verify that verb tenses reflect the change in temporal context:

> direct discourse:
>
>  She said, "I 
>
> will be
>
>  on time."
>
> indirect discourse:
>
>  She said she 
>
> would be
>
>  on time.     
>
> **direct discourse:** When he called he said, "I am at the airport"
>  **indirect discourse:** When he called he said he was at the airport.
