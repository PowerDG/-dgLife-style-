 **Verbs**  

Verb conjugations reflect three elements: the subject, the tense,  and the mood. The subject may be singular or plural and may be in the  first person ("I" or "we"), in the second person ("you"), or in the  third person "he," she," "it," or "they"). Verb tenses include different  forms of the past, present and future. The term "mood" refers,  generally, to the attitude of the speaker toward his subject. The  different moods include the indicative, the subjunctive (rare in  English), the conditional, and the imperative.
