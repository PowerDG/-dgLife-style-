**Objects**

Direct Object: A direct object will most often be a noun (thing or  idea) that receives the action of the transitive (action) verb. I threw  the ball.

 

 

  Indirect Object: An indirect object will most often be the person or  persons expressed as the recipient of the direct object and will be  found immediately after the transitive verb and before the direct  object. I threw him the ball. 

 Phrase: A phrase adds to the meaning of a sentence but does not contain a subject or a verb.
 The yellow house is at the bottom of the driveway. 

 Clause: A clause will contain a subject and a verb and function as either a dependent or an independent clause.
 See Dependent Clause 

 Adjective Clause: An adjective clause will begin with a relative pronoun  and give us more information about a noun or pronoun within a sentence.  See Dependent Clause. 

 Adverb Clause: An adverb clause will begin with a subordinating  conjunction and offer readers more information about the verb (usually  giving us information about time, place, or why something happened). See  Dependent Clause. 

 Noun Clause: A noun clause also begins with a relative pronoun but  functions differently from an adjective clause. The noun clause operates  in the subject position of a sentence, in the object position of a  sentence, or in the subject complement position of a sentence.
 That I studied the assignment was evident to the teacher. (Noun Clause as Subject)
 I forgot that I needed my passport. (Noun Clause as Direct Object)
 Pedro was looking for whatever he needed for the baseball game. (Noun Clause as Object of the Preposition) 

 Prepositional Phrase: A prepositional phrase always begins with a  preposition and ends with a noun (the object of the preposition). In  some cases, the object of the preposition will be a noun clause. The  prepositional phrase functions either as an adjective, telling us more  about a noun or pronoun, or an adverb, providing us more information  about the verb. (May be as short as two words or as many as several  words) 

 

 The student in the purple dress walked down the hallway. (Adjective and Adverb Prepositional Phrases, respectively) 

 Participial Phrase:  A participial phrase joins together a participle  and its corresponding words, functioning, always, as an adjective. The  participle may be present (ending in -ing) or past (ending in -ed or its  irregular form).
 The school, aged and bent from years of harsh weather, fell from its state of grace. (Past Participial Phrase)
 Swimming in a sea of grammar, the students splashed each other with verbs and nouns. (Present Participial Phrase)
 The singing bird trilled high notes in the early morning. (Participle)
