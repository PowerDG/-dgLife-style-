**Forms**

Adjectives are generally invariable in English and do not agree with nouns in number and gender; nor do they take case endings:

- a **blue** car
- the **great** outdoors
- a group of **young** women

However, a few adjectives have a connotation which is slightly masculine or feminine. Thus, one says that a woman is **beautiful** while a man would be called **handsome**.

Adjectives indicating religion or nationality (or a region, state or province) generally begin with a capital letter, whether they refer to people or objects:

- She is an **American** student.
- They go to a **Catholic** school.
- They enjoy **Breton** music.

**Usage:**

In a noun cluster an adjective will be placed, with very few exceptions, **in front of** the noun it modifies. When two adjectives precede a noun, they can be connected by a comma (,) or by the conjunction"**and**." In a series of three or more adjectives, one usually uses "**and**" before the last adjective in the list.

Examples:

- I like **short** novels.
- That fellow will be a **competent** worker.
- She writes **long** and **flowery** letters.
- He works **long**, **hard** hours.
- She had a **mean**, **old** and **overbearing** step-mother.

An adjective may follow the noun when it is in a predicate (after the verb) or in a relative clause. (In relative clauses the relative pronoun may be implicit.)

Examples:

- He was a man (who was) always **happy** to help others.
- She is a woman (who is) **true** to herself.
- They were entirely **satisfied**.
