**General principles**

The definite article "**the**" (invariable in form) designates a person, place, or event which has been specified or defined by the speaker:

- Here's the book I bought.
- The cat is on the roof.
- He said he would bring the money.

**Omission of the definite article**

The definite article does not always precede nouns: sometimes [indefinite articles](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/39.html) or [partitive articles](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/40.html) will be used. Often, though, no article at all is necessary, as in the following cases:

**1.** As a general rule, the definite article is omitted before abstract nouns or nouns representing general categories. It is often omitted after verbs expressing opinions or preferences:

- Truth is the highest good.
- I don't like animals.
- Cats are nicer than dogs.
- Time flies.
- She likes coffee, but she hates tea.

**2.** Generally, the article is omitted before days of the week and dates:

- On Tuesdays the museums are closed.
- On Saturdays I sleep in.
- Friday night we are going dancing.
- I was born on June 16, 1980.

**3.** Generally, the article is omitted before names of countries, states, cities, and regions:

- France is seventeen times smaller than the United States.

- California is larger than Brittany.    

  Exception: Some names actually include the definite article,    such as The Hague.

**4.** Generally, the article is omitted before titles or nouns indicating professions:

- President Mitterrand completed two terms.
- We saw Professor Miller at the restaurant.
- She met with Doctor Schmidt.

**The use of the definite article does not change in interrogatives and negatives.**
