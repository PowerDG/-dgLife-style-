**Formation**

**1.** Most adverbs are formed from the adjective. One adds the ending "**--ly**" to the adjectival form:

- intelligent --> intelligently
- slow --> slowly
- precise --> precisely

Some adverbs are irregular:

**A.** If the adjective ends with "**--le**," simply replace the "**e**" with "**y**":

- simple --> simply
- subtle --> subtly

**B.** The adverb corresponding to the adjective "**good**" is irregular:

- good --> well

**C.** Some adverbs have the same form as the adjective:

- high
- low
- hard
- better
- fast

**D.** In general, adverbs of time and space have no corresponding adjective; the same can be said of adverbs of quantity:

- yesterday
- today
- tomorrow
- early
- soon
- late
- here
- there
- less
- more
- as
- very
- much
- a lot of
- little of

 

**Position**

When an adverb modifies a verb, it generally comes at the end of the clause (but before any prepositional phrases or subordinated clauses):

- He writes poorly.

- She pronounced that word well..

- Joseph worked diligently.

- They worked 

  hard

   before coming home.    

  Exceptions: certain adverbs signaling the speaker's opinion,    such as "**probably**," "**undoubtedly**," "**surely**,"    "**certainly**," etc., come at the beginning of the sentence,    or else between the [modal verb](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) (or [auxiliary](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/7.html))    and the principal verb:

  - We are probably going to spend the summer in Corsica.
  - Certainly we would never do that!
  - We will undoubtedly see a dirty political campaign this year.

**Adverbs of time and space** generally come at the end of the sentence; however, they may be placed at the beginning of the sentence if the predicate clause is long and complicated:

- I saw her yesterday.
- We're going to the beach today.
- She went to bed very early.
- Tomorrow we will try to get up early to prepare for our trip.

**Adverbs modifying adjectives or an other adverb** are placed before the adjective or adverb they modify:

- She was really very happy to see you.
- It was a brilliantly staged performance.
