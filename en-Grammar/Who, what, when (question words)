**Simple questions**

Simple questions (that is, questions to which one can respond by a simple "yes" or "no") may be formed in three different ways:

**1. "Do"**: one precedes an assertion with "**do**" or "**does**" (or "**don't**" or "**doesn't**" for a negative expression, or "**did**", "**didn't**" for the past):

- Do you want to go to the movies?

- Does she work at IBM?

- Don't you travel quite a bit?

- Do they answer questions quickly?

- Didn't they want to eat?    

  **But**: One never places "**do**" or "**does**"    before the verb "**to be**" or before [modal    verbs](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) in questions; in this case it is preferable to [invert](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#inversion)    the subject and verb:

  - Are you coming to the reception?
  - Was the meeting boring?
  - Weren't you hungry?

 

**2. Inversion**: with certain verbs (especially the verbs "**to be**", "**to do**", "**to have**", and [modal verbs](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html)) questions are formed by inverting the subject and object. (In the case of the verb "**to have**," which is usually combined with "**do**" in interrogatives, inversion signals a literary style.)

- Is Jack home?
- Have you nothing to declare?
- Would you like to go to the movies?
- Will they ever come to visit?
- Can the employees talk to the boss?
- Won't you sit down?

 

**3. Modal phrases:** If a [modal verb](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) is used in a sentence, or if it is strongly implied, a modal phrase can be used to make an interrogative form. The modal phrase is typically an **inversion** of the subject and verb, in the **negative**, repeated at the end of the sentence:

- It's time to go, isn't it?

- He'd like to come with us, wouldn't he?

- You would like to go with us, wouldn't you?

- You can understand that, 

  can't you

  ? 

  In the case of a negative question, the modal phrase would be in the affirmative:

- You wouldn't want to try it, would you?

- She won't be back, will she?

 **Interrogative adverbs**

[Simple questions](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#simple) solicit a "yes" or "no" answer. More precise questions may be formed by using the interrogative adverbs: **when, why, how, how much, where**. Generally, the interrogative adverb precedes the rest of the question; then the order of the sentence follows the rules indicated for [inversion](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#inversion) or for [questions formed with "**do / does**"](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#do).

- Where are you going?
- Why do you want to take this class?
- How much do you earn a month?
- How do these machines work? *(Où vont ces étudiants ?)*
- When do you expect to get home? *(A quelle heure penses-tu rentrer ?)*

 **Interrogative pronouns**

Interrogative pronouns are used to ask who has done what, to whom, why, with what, etc. Normally these pronouns are placed at the beginning of the sentence; hen the order of the sentence follows the rules indicated for [inversion](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#inversion) or for [questions formed with "**do / does**"](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#do).

One chooses the pronoun based on its function, according to the following table:

![img](assets/interro-1550715973864.gif)

 

subject (person) : **who + question**

- Who did this painting?
- Who wants to get an ice cream?

subject (thing) : **what + question**

- What interests you?
- What is good in this restaurant?

direct object (person) : **whom + question**

- Whom did you see in France?
- Whom are you going to meet at this reception?

direct objet (thing) : **what + question**

- What do you want to do this evening?
- What are you preparing?

object of a preposition (person) : **preposition + whom + question**

- About whom are you thinking?

- With

  whom

   did you go out?    

  **Note:** In spoken English, one often places the    preposition at the end of the sentence, in which case one uses    "**who**" instead of "**whom**"

  - Who are you thinking about?
  - Who did you go out with?

object of a preposition (thing) : **preposition + what + question**

- With what did you open it?

- In what

   way does that concern you?    

  **Note:** In spoken English, the preposition is often put at the end of the sentence:

- What did you open it with?

- What did did they base their opinion on?

 

 **Which, which one, which ones**.

The adjective "**which**" and its pronominal forms ("**which**", **"which one**", "**which ones**") ask that a person make a choice. Usually these pronouns will be placed at the beginning of the sentence; Normalement, ces pronoms se trouveront au début de la phrase ; then the order of the sentence follows the rules indicated for [inversion](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#inversion) or for [questions formed with "**do / does**"](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/33.html#do).

- Which film do you want to see?
- Which date did you choose?
- Here are two pizzas. Which one do you prefer?
- There are many different Burgundy wines. Which ones do you like?
