**Conditional**

The conditional is formed using the [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) "**would**" in front of an infinitive (dropping the word "**to**"). The conditional is used especially in three contexts:

1) Politeness

- I would like the menu, please.
- Would you have a couple of minutes for me?

2) To indicate the "future within the past":

- She said she would come to the party.
- I thought he would arrive before me.

3) In hypothetical constructions with "**if**." When "**if**" is followed by the preterit or the subjunctive, the conditional is expected in the second clause:

- If I had the time, I would do my homework.

- If you told me the truth, I 

  would believe

   you.    

  The "**if**" of hypothetical expressions can be    implicit:

- In your position (= if I were you), I wouldn't have    stayed.
