**Indirect Speech**

Direct and Indirect Speech

Direct speech can also be called "quoted" speech. We use direct  speech when we want to reproduce someone's words exactly. We always use  quotation marks. 

Elizabeth said, "I'm tired.‚Äù  Jessie said, "I want a new job." 

Indirect speech can also be called "reported" speech. We use indirect  speech when we want to reproduce the idea of someone's words without  using their exact words. The verb forms and pronouns may change, and  quotation marks are not used.

Elizabeth said that she was tired. Jessie said that she wanted a new job.

Notice that the verbs in the examples changed to the past in the  indirect speech statements to coordinate with the past tense verb  "said". Look at these verb changes:

 Sam says, "I drive to work." 
     	Sam says that he drives to work.
 Sam said, <I drive to work.>
     	Sam said (that) he drove to work.
 Sam said, <I am driving to work.>
     	Sam said (that) he was driving to work.
 Sam said, <I have driven to work.>
     	Sam said (that) he had driven to work.
 Sam said, <I drove to work.>
     	Sam said (that) he had driven to work.
 Sam said, <I will drive to work.>
     	Sam said (that) he would drive to work.
 Sam said, <I can drive to work.>
     	Sam said (that) he could drive to work.
 Sam said, <I may drive to work.>
     	Sam said (that) he might drive to work.
