 **Demonstrative adjectives and pronouns**

 

**Demonstrative adjectives**

Demonstrative adjectives have two singular forms (**this**, **that**) and two plural forms (**these**, **those**). These adjectives are used to designate proximity to an object, or to distinguish between an object that is close (in time or space) and one that is more remote. Usually "**this**" and "**these**" signal proximity, while "**that**" and "**those**" suggest distance:

- These books are too expensive.
- This car is responsive.
- That man irritates me!
- This hotel is more expensive than that one.

 

**Demonstrative pronouns**

Demonstrative pronouns have the same form as the demonstrative adjectives, but are used without the nouns to which they refer. In the singular, when designating a specific object, the pronoun "**one**" is often added:

- These tomatoes are fresher than those.

- These are better than those.

- Would you like a little of this?

- That strikes me as really weird!

- The book is more interesting than 

  that one

  .         

  **In front of a relative pronoun,** the demonstrative    pronoun becomes "**the one**" or "**the ones**" (when    speaking of things), or "**he / she who**", "**they who**"    (when speaking of people):

- This film is the one that you hated so much.

- He who eats well works well.

- This pen is the one with which the President signed the    new law.
