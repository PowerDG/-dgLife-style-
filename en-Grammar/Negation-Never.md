**"Not"**

The most common way to put a phrase in the negative is by using "**not**." Generally, "**not**" must follow an [auxiliary](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/7.html) verb ("**to be**", "**to do**") or a  [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) ("**shall**", "**must**", "**might**", "**will**", etc.), even if this verb adds no meaning to the sentence. When no other modal is present or appropriate, the verb "**to do**" is used. 

Here are some sample phrases in both affirmative and negative form:

- I want to play the piano.
      --> I do not want to play the piano.

- He will arrive on time.
      --> He will not arrive on time.

- They should go out together.

  â€‹    --> They 

  should not

   go out together.        

  **Note:** Most often, the adverb "**not**" will be    contracted to "**--n't**" after an [auxiliary](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/7.html)    or [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) verb:

  - is not --> isn't
  - should not --> shouldn't
  - does not --> doesn't
  - must not --> mustn't
  - has not --> hasn't
  - will not --> won't

**Questions**

The same structure (placing "**not**" after the verb) will hold for questions:

- Isn't it time to leave?

- Would

  n't

   you care for a drink?        

  **Note:** If one chooses not contract "**not**" to    "**--n't**", the adverb "**not**" will be placed after the    subject in the question. This style is considered literary:

  - Is it not time to leave.
  - Would you not care for a drink?

Using "**not**" instead of the contraction can produce certain stylistic effects:

**To stress the negative meaning of the sentence:**

- "He will not come to your house" is stronger than "He    won't come to your house"

**To affect a literary style**, especially in the formation of a questions:

- Will you not come by and see us?

 

**Negative constructions**

Other negative constructions are possible. Because English does not allow double or triple negatives, it is important to avoid using "**not**" with other negative constructions. When "**not**" is included, use the affirmative forms of other adverbs:

**No more / not... any more**

- I want no more of your money
- I don't want any more of your money.

**No one / not... anyone**

- No one called tonight.
- I don't want to see anyone tonight.

**Never / not... ever**

- She never wants to see him again.
- She doesn't ever want to see him again.

**Nothing / not... anything**

- He does nothing at all.
- Can't you do anything right?

**Nowhere / not... anywhere**

- Where are you going? -- Nowhere.
- I don't want to go anywhere.

**Not a single / not... a single**

- Not a single letter arrived today.
- He doesn't have a single idea what we're doing.

**Neither... nor...**

- We neither ate nor drank during the ceremony.
- I like neither tomatoes nor zucchini.

**Only** (always placed before the element one whichs to limit):

- She only has seven dollars.
- We were only playing.
- They were the only ones to come.
