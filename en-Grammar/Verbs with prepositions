**Verbs with prepositions**

Certain verbs and verbal expressions are generally followed by a preposition before their object (and this preposition will generally be shown in the dictionary).

However, the **meaning** of these verbs is not dramatically changed by the addition of the preposition. The same **cannot** be said of the prepositional verbs, dealt with in [another section](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/25.html).

Examples:

- to wait for
- to look for
- to look at
- to listen to
- to pay for
- to ask for
- to be happy with something
- to be mad at (or: with) someone
- to depend on
- to be interested in
- to thank for
- to be busy with

 Sample sentences:

- She's the one who paid for our dinner!
- I'm not asking for anything!
- I'm busy with my own stuff.
- That depends on you.
