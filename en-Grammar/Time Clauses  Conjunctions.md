**Time Clauses / Conjunctions**

 Conjunctions of Time
 We can join two sentences using a conjunction. A conjunction of time  gives us information about when two events happen, relative to each  other.
 Common conjunctions of time are when, while, as soon as, until, after and before. 

 When can be used to show that one event is before, or at the same time  as, another. When can be used to convey a past or a future meaning. 
 I studied abroad for a year when I was at university.
 When she finishes this course, she’ll go abroad for a year. 
 As soon as means that the second event happened, or will happen, immediately after the first. 
 As soon as I finished lunch, I went out for a walk. I’ll go out for a walk as soon as I finish lunch. 

 Notice that in the second example the verb in the present simple has a future meaning. 

 Not … until means the same as not … before. 
 I didn’t leave home until I got married. 

 After and before can be followed by a subject-verb clause or by a gerund.

 Before coming back to Britain, I travelled all over Eastern Europe. 

 While can be used to show two events happening at the same time.
 While you’re getting lunch ready, I’ll wash the car.
 I studied judo while I was in Japan. 

 While and During
 While and during are both used to show that two things happen at the  same time. While is a conjunction and is used before a subject-verb  clause. During is a preposition and is used before a noun phrase.  

 What should you do during an earthquake?
 Don’t run downstairs while the building is shaking.
