When one does not carry out an action oneself but rather has the action done by someone else, this is expressed by a causative construction. In English it is the verb "**to have**" that introduces the causative. The model will generally be: "**to have**" (conjugated) **+ direct object** (noun or pronoun) **+ principal verb** (in its past participle form):

- We'll have a monument erected on this site.
- I had my hair cut.

When one wishes to designate the agent of the action (the person who  has carried out the described action), there are two possibilities:

\1. -- "**to have**" (conjugated) **+ direct object** (noun or pronoun) **+ principal verb** (in its past participle form) + "**by**" + **agent** (usually not as a pronoun):

- The professor had the work done by his lab assistants.
- I had it done by my employees.

\2. -- "**to have**" (conjugated) **+ agent** (as a direct object noun or pronoun) **+ principal verb** (in its infinitive form) + **the object** (also in the form of a direct object noun or pronoun)

- The professor had his students write an essay.
- I had him do it.

**Note:** Especially in spoken English, the verb "**to get**" often replaces "**to have**," in which case "**to**" is added to the infinitive (but not before past participles). This construction also suggests that it may be (or have been) difficult to produce a certain reaction on the part of the agent:

- We'll get a monument erected on this site.
- The professor got his students to write an essay.

When one wishes to express a change in temperament or in general conditions, it is the construction "**to make + adjective**" which is used:

- That letter made her sad.
- He makes me furious!
- That new problem made negotiations really hard!
