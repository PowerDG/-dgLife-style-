**Past conditional**

The past conditional is expressed using the [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) "**would**" before a past infinitive (= **"have" +** [**past participle**](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/15.html)). This construction serves to express missed opportunities and past hypotheses:

- She told me that she would have liked to come and see    us.
- In your position, I would have done the same    thing.

One finds it often in hypothetical constructions with "**if**." When "**if**" is followed by the pluperfect, the conditional past is expected in the second clause:

- If I had had the time, I would have done my    homework.
- If you had told me the truth, I would have believed    you.
- If he had worked harder, he'd have received a better    grade.

**Note:** In certain regions (principally in the United States) one hears the conditional past in both clauses of hypothetical expressions:

- If you would have told me he was going to win, I    wouldn't have believed you.
