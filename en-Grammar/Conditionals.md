**Conditionals**

There are four common conditional forms. The zero and first  conditionals are also called ‘real’ conditionals. The second and third  conditionals are also called ‘unreal’ conditionals.

 Zero Conditional
 The zero conditional is an if/then statement that is used to express a scientific fact or something that is generally true. 

 Form:  If + subject +present simple verb, subject + present simple verb.
 Or
 Subject + present simple verb +  if + subject + present simple verb. 

 Examples:
 If you put sugar in your tea, it  becomes sweet. 
 The trip takes 35 minutes if you take the express train. 

 First Conditional
 The first conditional is an if/then statement that expresses the consequence of a probable or possible situation in the future. 

 Form:  If + subject + present simple verb, subject + will + verb
 Or 
 Subject + will + verb + if + subject + present simple verb 

 Examples:
 If you call before 11 p.m., I will pick you up from the station.
 I’ll burst if I eat any more food! 

 Second Conditional
 The second conditional is an if/then statement that expresses the  consequence of a hypothetical, imaginary, impossible, or improbable  situation in the future. 

 Form:  If + subject + simple past verb, subject + would + verb
 Or
 Subject + would+ verb + if + subject + simple past verb 

 Examples:
 If I had a million dollars, I would buy a mansion in Florida.
 I would wear a coat if I were you. (It’s really cold outside.) 

 Third Conditional
 The third conditional is an if/then statement that expresses what would  have happened if events in the past were different. It is often used to  express regret about actions in the past the speaker would like to  change.  

 Form:  If + subject + past perfect, subject + would + have + past participle
 Or 
 Subject + would + have + past participle + if + subject +past perfect 

 Examples:
 If I had known about the divorce, I wouldn’t have asked him about his wife.
 (I didn’t know about the divorce and I asked him about this wife. I  regret that I asked him and would change the past if possible.)  
 Sally would have bought a new car if she had received a raise at her  job. (Sally didn’t buy the new car but would have under different  circumstances in the past.)
