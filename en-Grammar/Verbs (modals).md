**General principles**

The auxiliary modals "**would**," **may**," "**might**," "**should**," "**must**," "**ought to**," "**can**," "**could**," "**will**," "**shall**" are invariable. They exist only in the present, and unlike most verbs in the [simple present](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/2.html), their form does not change in the third person singular.

Modal verbs are auxiliaries, or "helping" verbs: they are used in conjunction with another verb (in infinitive form) as a way to modify its meaning. Modals can nuance the meaning of the principal verb in a number of ways:

> -- Possibility or ability, 
>
> by "
>
> can
>
> " or    "
>
> could
>
> "        
>
> - I can do this job.
> - Could you please do the dishes?
>
> **-- Possibility or permission** by "**may**" or    "**might**" (often translated in other languages by a different    mood, such as the [subjonctif](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/13.html)).
>
> - I may finish my paper tonight.
> - You may come with us, if you wish.
> - It might be helpful to have a map.
>
> **-- Obligation,** or moral obligation, by "**must**,"    "**ought to**," or "**should**":
>
> - Students must hand in their work on time.
> - You ought to see a doctor.
> - You should never play with fire.
>
> **Note** that "**must**" can also indicate    probability:
>
> - You must be exhausted!
> - He must play tennis pretty well.
>
> The modal verb "**would**" is used to express the [conditional](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/8.html):
>
> - If he had time, he would pick up some groceries.
>
> The modal verb "**will**" expresses the [future](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/18.html):
>
> - The train will arrive in an hour.

**Contractions**

After a pronoun subject, "**would**" is often contracted into "**--'d**" ("**I'd**", "**we'd**", "**she'd**", etc.), while "**will**" is contracted into "**--'ll**" ("**I'll**", "**you'll**", "**they'll**", etc.). After all modal verbs, the word"**not**" of the negative can be contracted into "**--n't**" ("**wouldn't**", "**shouldn't**", etc.).

> Exceptions :
>
>  "
>
> will not
>
> " becomes    "
>
> won't
>
> ". "
>
> Can not
>
> " can also be written    "
>
> cannot
>
> "; in its contracted form, the "
>
> n
>
> " is not    doubled: "
>
> can't
>
> ".        
>
> **Note:** The contraction of the modal verbs "**shall**,"    "**ought**," and "**may**," is considered slightly archaic    or literary.
>
> examples of contractions:
>
> - I wouldn't (would not) do that, if I were you!
> - They'll (they will) never believe it!
> - She won't (will not) bother you anymore.

 

**Question tag phrases ("isn't it," "wasn't it," etc.)**

Modals can be used in a negative interrogative form after an affirmative expression. The function of such an expression is to prompt the listener to reassert or reaffirm what has been stated:

- You would like to go with us, wouldn't you?
- You can understand that, can't you?

The modal verb used in the interrogative tag is generally the same as the modal found in the main clause; the subject pronoun is also repeated.

After a **negative** sentence, the modal tag phrase is in the **affirmative:**

- You wouldn't want to try it, would    you? *(**Je suppose que tu    ne voudrais pas l'essayer.**)*
- She won't be back, will she?
