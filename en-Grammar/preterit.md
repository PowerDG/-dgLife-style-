**The preterit**

As a general rule, the preterit is formed by adding the ending "--**ed**" to the infinitive (dropping any unpronounced "**e**" in final position, and changing any final "**y**" to "**i**"):

- to walk --> walked
- to answer --> answered
- to want --> wanted
- to smile --> smiled
- to cry --> cried

The preterit forms of many common verbs are irregular:

- to be --> was (singular), were (plural)
- to have --> had
- to do --> did
- to make --> made
- to eat --> ate
- to go --> went
- to drink --> drank
- to think --> thought
- to bring --> brought
- to drive --> drove
- to write --> wrote
- to sing --> sang
- to build --> built

**Usage**

The preterit expresses actions which were completed in the past. Unlike those described by the [present perfect](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/5.html), these actions do not continue in the present. Unlike the [past progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/11.html), the preterit does not describe the process or duration of actions: it states them only as completed actions:

- She went to the store this afternoon.
- They called the police.
- He came, he saw, he conquered.

The duration of the action is of no importance: the preterit may describe an action lasting an instant or many years. Thus verbs indicating belief, emotion, possession, location, etc. will often be expressed in the preterit:

- I lived in London for three years.
- She owned three dogs throughout her childhood.
- I never trusted what they told me.

In the negative and interrogative, the [auxiliary](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/7.html) verb "**to do**" -- conjugated in the preterit -- will be used with the infinitive to express the past:

- Did you arrive in time?
- Didn't you eat yet?
- We didn't go to the movies after all.
