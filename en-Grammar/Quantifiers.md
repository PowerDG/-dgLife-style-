**Quantifiers**

 Using Some, Any, and No
 We use both some and any with plural countable nouns and with uncountable nouns. 

 They tasted some delicious wines in Italy.
 Do you have any Seville oranges?
 I don’t have any tea, but I have some coffee.
 Did you get any brown bread? 

 We use some in affirmative sentences and in questions when we think the answer will be “yes.”
 I bought some bread and some eggs today.
 Would you like some more wine? 

 We use any in most general questions and in negative sentences, .
 Are there any dragons on Lombok?
 There aren’t any snakes in Ireland. 

 Much, Many and a Lot of
 We use many and a lot of with countable nouns in the plural.
 They saw many stars in the sky.
 They grow a lot of bananas in Ecuador. 

 We use much and a lot of with uncountable nouns.
 They eat a lot of rice in Malaysia.
 My family doesn’t eat much red meat. 

 We prefer to use a lot of and lots of in affirmative sentences and much and many in negative sentences and questions. 

 A Little and a Few
 A few means the same as “some, but not many.” A little means the same as “some, but not much.”
 I eat a few apples each week.	There’s a little cheese left.
 

 Much, many, a lot, a little, and a bit 
 Much or a lot can be used before the comparative form to show that there is a big difference between two people or things.  

 A little or a bit can be used to show a small difference.  
 We can use these words with adjectives, adverbs, and nouns.  

 With adjectives: 
 Austrians are much more formal than Swedes, and they are much less direct. Austrian food is a lot heavier than Swedish food. 
 Austria is a bit cheaper than Sweden. 
 Biology is a little easier than Chemistry. 

 Remember that we cannot use a double comparative. 
 (right) Austrian food is much heavier. 
 (wrong) Austrian food is much more heavier.  

 With adverbs: 
 She speaks a little more quietly than I do. 
 She speaks a bit more quietly than I do. 
 He drives a lot more slowly than you do.  

 With nouns: 
 If the noun is uncountable, we use much or a lot  (for a big difference), and a little or a bit  (for a small difference).   

 In Sweden they eat a lot of fish. 
 They don’t have much sunshine in winter.   

 If the noun is countable, we use many or a lot (for a big difference),  and a few for a small difference, except when using fewer.   

 Many Saabs are driven in Sweden.
 There are a lot of university students in Boston.
 There are fewer hours of daylight in an Alaskan winter than in a Mexican winter.
 You’ve gained a few pounds. 

 Most/Some
 Look at these sentences. They all contain the words most and some. Not  all the sentences contain of. When you are talking more generally, don’t  use of.
 Most people would rather be young than old.  

 If we are referring to a specific time period or area, or if we are talking about part of a larger whole, we would use of (the).
 During the flood of  1994, most of the rain fell within a two-day period.
 Some of my friends don’t eat pizza. 

 A few  and few
 A little and little 

 Little and few (without a) mean “not a lot.” They often have a negative meaning. 

 We have little time before our guests arrive for dinner. We must hurry to finish the cooking.
 There are few vegetables that he likes. He almost never eats them. 

 Note:	Use little with non-countable nouns like bread, rice, fruit, patience.
       	Use few with countable plural nouns like bananas, pieces, and meals. 

 You can use very with few as well as with little. 

 He has very little patience with people who drink too much alcohol.
 Very few bananas grow in Scotland. 

 A little and a few mean “some” or “a small amount.” They have a more positive meaning than little and few. 

 We have a little time for coffee before our flight. Let’s stop in at that cafe.
 He makes a few dishes that everyone likes. For example, everyone loves his spaghetti. 

 If you use only with a few or a little, the meaning can become more negative.

 Only a few meals at the university cafeteria were strictly vegetarian. Most of the time, meat was served.
