**Sentence Types**

 Simple Sentence: A sentence that contains one and only one independent clauses and no dependent clauses.
 The young boy smiled at the big dog. 

 Compound Sentence: A sentence that contains at least two independent  clauses and no dependent clauses. Essential to the compound sentence is  its punctuation, as it must contain either a comma and a coordinating  conjunction (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) or a semi-colon that  conjoins the two independent clauses. Joseph taught the students about  delivering speeches, and Sarah taught them composition skills.

 Because the weather forecaster announced the threat of an impending  hurricane, the students canceled their luxurious boat cruise to the  Azores. 

 Compound-Complex Sentence: A sentence that contains at least two  independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. Because the  weather forecaster announced the threat of an impending hurricane, the  students canceled their luxurious boat cruise to the Azores, but the  cruise line would not refund the studentsâ€™ money.  

 Independent/dependent clauses
 Independent Clause: Typically thought of as a sentence, offering its  readers a complete thought and containing a subject, verb, and its  complement (Prepositional Phrase, Direct Object, Adjectival, or  Adverbial). The grammar book was thick. 

 Dependent Clause: A clause that cannot stand alone and does not offer  its reader a complete thought. A dependent clause will typically be an  Adjective, Adverb, or Noun clause.
