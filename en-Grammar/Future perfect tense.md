**Future perfect**

Relatively rare in English, the future perfect serves to express one future action which **precedes** a future moment or another future action. Moreover, it asserts that these actions will be **completed** before the principal action. It is formed by adding the [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) "**will**" to the [auxiliary](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/7.html) "**have**," preceding the [past participle](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/15.html):

- She will have finished before eight o'clock.
- Tomorrow morning they will all have left.
- They will already have finished eating by the    time we get there.

One can often use the [simple future](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/18.html) instead of the future perfect, but a nuance is lost: the [simple future](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/18.html) does not emphasize the completion of the first action:

- Tomorrow morning they will all leave. (The future perfect    would emphasize that they will already have departed    before tomorrow morning.)
- They will finish eating by the time we get there. (They may    finish just as we arrive; the future perfect would emphasize that    they will have finished before we arrive.)
