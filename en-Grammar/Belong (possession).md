In English possession may be expressed in five different ways:

**Possessive adjectives**

Possessive adjectives agree with the person to whom they refer:

- **I --> my**

- **you --> your**

- **he, she, it --> his** (masculine)**, her**    (feminine)**, its** (impersonal)

- **we --> our**

- they --> their

  So,

- I have lost my keys.

- They are coming in their car.

- I met your grandparents.

- This car has lost its power.

**Note:** In English the possessive adjective is used to refer to parts of the body:

- She brushes her teeth twice a day.
- He broke his arm playing soccer.
- His stomach aches.

**Possessive pronouns**

Possessive pronouns, like the adjectives, agree with the person to whom they refer. Singular and plural share the same form:

- **I --> mine**

- **your --> yours**

- **he, she, it --> his** (masculine)**, hers**    (feminine), **its** (impersonal)

- **we --> ours**

- they --> theirs

  So,

- I have my likes, and she has hers.

- If you give me one of yours, I'll give you one of    mine.

- I like our house, but frankly, I am jealous of    theirs!

- That's mine!

 

**The verb "to belong to"**

The verb "**to belong to**" indicates ownership or possession:

- That poodle belongs to Louise.
- The world belongs to you.

 

**The "s" of possession**

One may add "--'s" to any noun in order to indicate possession:

- I just read Gustave's book.
- The front door's lock is broken.
- Many of the world's countries are poor.

**Note**: Do not confuse the "s" of possession with the contraction of the verb "is":

- Fred's going to fetch it. (= Fred **is** going to fetch    it.)
- The train's late again. (=The train **is** late    again.)

 

**"Whose" for indicating possession**

"Whose" will be placed before the possession (the object possessed), and will refer ownership to the preceding noun:

- The man whose dog bit me said he was sorry. (The dog belongs    to the man.)
- Here is the woman whose daughter I intend to marry.(The woman    is the mother of the daughter.)
