 **Partitive article:"some"**

When the article "**some**" appears before a plural noun it functions like an indefinite article:

- He has some tickets for the game.
- Some students decided not to attend the class.

However, when "**some**" appears before a singular noun, it is being used as a partitive. This is to say that a part of something is indicated, or a partial (or indeterminate) quantity is referred to. It is often used after verbs of possession or consumption:

- Do you have some time?

- We're going to buy some milk.

- I heard some bad news.

- She has some money to spend.

- Would you like 

  some

   help ? 

  **Note:** After expressions of quantity, the partitive article is not used:

- Students buy a lot of pastries.

- Today people have more activities than before.

In negative expressions, the partitive article "**some**" generally becomes "**any**" (this change will also occur in negative interrogatives):

- She doesn't have any money.
- They didn't have any milk.
- Don't you have any money?

The word "**any**" is not strictly necessary in the negative,and it may often be omitted:

- I never have accidents.
- They didn't have milk.
