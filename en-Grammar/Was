**Auxiliary verbs**

An auxiliary verb ("helping" verb) is combined with the principal verb to form certain tenses or moods. (See also the [modal verbs](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html), which nuance the meaning of the verbs they accompany.) The only true auxiliary verbs in English are "**to be**," "**to have**," and "**to do**."
