 **Simple present (indicative)**

The simple present is used to express actions which take place in the present or which occur regularly. It also serves to express general or absolute statements not anchored in a particular time frame.

- I work at home.
- Politics are a dirty business.
- Jill speaks four languages fluently.
- On Sundays, we like to fish.

In the interrogative, the present is generally introduced by a form of the verb "**to do**" ("**do / does**"):

- Does your father like to cook?
- Do you have time to stop by my place?

The appropriate form of the verb "**to do**" will also be used for the negative:

- I do not (don't) work at home.
- No, he does not (doesn't) like to cook.

After the conjunctions "**when**," "**as soon as**," etc., the present is used, even though actions expressed may refer to the future:

- She'll come when she can.

- He'll pay us as soon as we 

  finish

  .        

   

**Forming the simple present**

The present is extremely regular in its conjugation. As a general rule, one uses the base form of the infinitive (minus the preposition "to"). For the third person singular ("he," "she," "it"), an "**-s**" is added if the verb ends in a consonant, or "**-es**" if the verb ends with a vowel:

> To work
>
> - I work
> - you work
> - he / she / it works
> - we work
> - they work
>
> **To go**
>
> - I go
> - you go
> - he / she / it goes
> - we go
> - they go
>
> **However:** verbs ending with "consonant + y" (for example,    "**to try**," "**to cry**," "**to bury**," etc.) will end    in "**-ies**" in the third person singular:
>
> **To bury**
>
> - I bury
> - you bury
> - he / she buries
> - we bury
> - they bury

 

> "To have", "to be" 
>
> The only irregular verbs in the present are "**to have**,"    "**to be**," and the [modal verbs](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html).
>
> > To have
> >
> > - I have
> > - you have
> > - he / she has
> > - we have
> > - they have
> >
> > **To be**
> >
> > - I am
> > - you are
> > - he / she is
> > - we are
> > - they are
