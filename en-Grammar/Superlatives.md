**General principles**

When comparing **two** things one uses the [comparative;](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/36.html) however, for comparisons in larger groups, it is the superlative which must be used. The superlative designates extremes: the best, the first, the worst, the last, etc.

The superlative operates like the [comparative](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/36.html), with these exceptions:

**A.** While the word "**more**" or the ending "**--er**" signals the comparative, it is the word "**most**" or the ending "**--est**" that designates the superlative. (See [irregular forms](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/37.html#formes), below):

- He is the most efficient worker we have.
- That is the poorest family in the neighborhood.

**B.** The compared term (adjective or adverb) will be preceded by the definite article:

- He works the fastest of any student I know.
- She is the tallest woman in town.

**B.** Unlike the comparative, the superlative is not followed by "**than**": instead, one uses "**of**," followed by the context of the comparison (although this context is sometimes implicit):

- It's the best day of my life!
- She works the best of the whole class.
- She's the one who arrived first.

 

**Irregular forms**

**Adjectives**

> Monosyllabic adjectives (and several common two-syllable adjectives) take the ending "
>
> --est
>
> " in superlatives of superiority, and thus will not use the adverb "
>
> most
>
> ." However, these same adjectives will use "
>
> less
>
> ," like other adjectives, in superlatives of inferiority:     
>
> - young --> youngest
>
> - tall --> tallest
>
> - old --> oldest 
>
>   If the adjective ends in "**--y**" the "**y**" becomes "**i**":
>
> - heavy --> heaviest
>
> - early --> earliest
>
> - busy --> busiest
>
> - healthy --> healthiest
>
> - chilly --> chilliest
>
>   If the adjective ends in "**--e**" one adds only "--**st**" :
>
> - wise --> wisest
>
> - large --> largest
>
> - simple --> simplest
>
> - late --> latest
>
>   If the adjective ends in "**single vowel** + **consonant**," the consonant is doubled and one adds "**--est**":
>
> - red --> reddest
>
> - big --> biggest
>
> - thin --> thinnest
>
> - hot --> hottest 
>
>   Some very common superlatives have irregular forms:
>
> - good --> best
>
> - bad --> worst
>
> - far --> farthest 
>
>   Some adjectives exist only in superlative form:
>
> - first
>
> - last

**Adverbs**

> Adverbs not ending in "
>
> --ly
>
> " do not use the adverb "
>
> --most
>
> " in the formation of superlatives of superiority, but use instead the ending "
>
> --est
>
> ." However, these same adverbs will use "
>
> less
>
> ," like other adverbs, in superlatives of inferiority:     
>
> - fast --> fastest
> - hard --> hardest
>
> And some adverbs have irregular forms:
>
> - well --> best
> - badly --> worst
> - far --> farthest
