**Too, Very and Enough**

 We use too and very to modify the meaning of adjectives and adverbs. Too  and very come before the adjective and adverb. Enough usually comes  after the adjective. 

 Too means “more than necessary” or “more than you want.” Very  intensifies an adjective or adverb and means “to a large extent.” Enough  means “what is adequate or necessary.”
