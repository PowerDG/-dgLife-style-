**General principles**

The present progressive is a version of the present which emphasizes the fact that an action is still unfolding (or is continuing) at the time one speaks. It is formed by using the auxilary "**to be**" with the [present participle](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/41.html):

- I am working.
- He is eating his dinner.
- The cat is meowing.

Usually, the present progressive indicates that one is "**in the process of**" or "**in the midst of**" doing something. If this is the idea one wishes to communicate, the present progressive will be preferable to the simple present. If you cannot replace the verb by a form of "**to be in the process of**," the present progressive should probably not be used. Indications of emotion, belief, and possession are rarely conjugated in the present progressive:

- I think that is right. ["I am in the process of thinking"    would be awkward.]
- Cheryl owns her own house. ["Cheryl is in the process of    owning" would be awkward.]

In certain situations the present progressive can indicate an action which will take place in the immediate future:

- I am going to the movies this evening.
- They are leaving tomorrow.

[**Near future**](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/16.html)**:** To emphasize the idea of future action while using the present tense, one may use the verb "**to go**"; it indicates what one is *going to do***.** In this case the principle verb remains in the infinitive:

- I know he is going to yell at me!

- They are going to regret that decision.    

  **Note:** The near future can also be used in past    constructions, in which case the verb "**to go**" is conjugated    in the past progressive:

  - She was going to leave, but the telephone rang.

**Present progressive in the negative**

The word "**not**" comes after the auxiliary "**to be**":

- He is not working very hard.
- You are not driving fast enough.
