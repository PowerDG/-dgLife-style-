**The imperative**

Imperatives are used to issue commands. They use the infinitive of verbs (dropping the word "**to**"); in the first person plural ("**we**"), the infinitive is preceded by "**let's**" (or: "**let us**"):

- Speak!
- Finish your homework!
- Let's eat!
- Close the door!

The negative imperative is formed by placing "**don't**" (or "**do not**") before the imperative form; in the first person plural one uses "**let's not**" (or "**let us not**") :

- Let's not forget who helped us.
- Don't leave me!
- Don't walk on the grass!
- Please don't eat the daisies!

The imperative has no effect on the word order of the rest of the sentence.
