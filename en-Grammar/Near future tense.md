**Near future**

Especially in spoken English one finds the *near future* used as a way of describing imminent events. Strictly speaking, the near future is not a future tense, for it is formed by combining the present tense of the verb "**to go**," conjugated in the [present progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/4.html), with the infinitive of the principal verb.

- We are going to leave soon.
- I'm going to give her a call.

Also used to express imminent actions is the construction "to be about to do something," also conjugated in the present.

- I am about to lose my temper!
- The detective is about to stop the criminal.

One can also conjugate these forms in the [past progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/11.html) in order to express a "future within the past":

- He said he was going to do it.
- She was going to buy a new car, but she never did.
- When I saw them, they were about to make a decision.
