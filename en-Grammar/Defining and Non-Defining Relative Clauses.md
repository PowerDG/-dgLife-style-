**Defining and Non-Defining Relative Clauses**

A relative clause gives us information about the noun it modifies. A  defining relative clause gives essential information about the noun it  modifies. The sentence would not make sense if the clause were removed.  Defining relative clauses often come right after the nouns that they  modify, without a comma.

 People who eat healthy foods live longer.
 Whatâ€™s the name of the hotel that you stayed at? 

 A non-defining relative clause gives us additional but non-essential  information about the noun it modifies. The sentence would still make  sense if the non-defining clause were removed. In writing, non-defining  relative clauses are usually separated from the rest of the sentence by  commas before and after the clause.
