**Present perfect progressive**

A close relative of the present perfect, the present perfect progressive, emphasizes the continuation of a single action: it indicates that the action is ongoing or continuing at the moment one is speaking. The form -- relatively complicated -- consists of the past auxiliary "**to have**" + "**been**" (the past participle of "**to be**") + the [**present participle**](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/41.html) of the principal verb. For example:

- I have been trying to reach you all afternoon.
- They have been working hard to finish their project.
