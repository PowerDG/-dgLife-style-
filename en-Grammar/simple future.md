 **The simple future**

The simple future uses the [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) "**will**" followed by the infinitive (dropping the presposition "**to**"). It serves to express actions which will take place at a specified time, or to signal the beginning of an action. (If, on the other hand, one wishes to describe an action which is in the process of occurring, it is the [future progressive](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/19.html) which will be used to express it.)

- I will meet you at five o'clock.
- She will go to the library this evening.
- We will dance all night long.

One sometimes find the [modal](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html) "**shall**" in place of "**will**." This usage, generally reserved for the first person, is considered archaic:

- What shall I do ?

**Note:** this usage of "**shall**" to indicate the future is different from the commonplace usage of "**shall**" to indicate desire or wishes. See [modal verbs](https://cns.ef-cdn.com/EtownResources/Grammar/3.html).
