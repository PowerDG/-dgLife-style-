**So and neither with be and do**

 We use so and neither (or not…either) when we want to agree that something that is true for some person is true for us, too. 
 We use so (or …too) with positive sentences and neither (or not…either) with negative sentences.
 If the main verb is be, use be in the response. If the main verb is other than be, use do in the response. 

 Response form: 
         	So + verb + subject	 (agreement with positive sentence)
       	Neither + verb + subject (agreement with negative sentence) 

 Examples, if the same is true for the respondent : 

- I’m very sociable.		So am I. (Or: I am, too.)
- I’m not very tall.		Neither am I. (Or:  I’m not, either.)
- We  like parties.		So do we. (Or: We do, too.)
- She doesn’t like snakes.	Neither does he. (Or: He doesn’t, either.)



 We use the verb be or the auxiliary verb do without so or neither when  we want to say that what is true for some person is not true for us. 

 Examples, if the same is not true for the respondent: 

- They’re tired.		We’re not.
- I’m not sleepy.		I am.
- He likes mushrooms.	She doesn’t.
- We don’t like art.	We do.
